"""Find a feature's counterpart at other layers, then ablate the pair together.

``multisite_ablation`` transplants one layer's decoder direction to its neighbours.
That answers "does removing this direction at more places do more", but it does
not identify the feature at those layers -- each layer has its own SAE and its own
numbering, so L15 #81663 and L31 #81663 are unrelated by construction.

This job identifies the counterpart first, then intervenes on the identified pair:

    match     for every candidate at the target layer, four independent signals
              measured on the SAME discovery items -- decoder cosine, activation
              correlation, effect correlation (does ablating each move the margin
              the same way per item), and specificity correlation (does ablating
              each move the *cue-attributable* part of the margin the same way,
              hostile minus its matched no-cue twin). Ranked by their geometric
              mean, so a high cosine alone cannot win; cosine alone is exactly the
              failure mode this exists to avoid, the dictionary being overcomplete.
              Specificity is not a restatement of the effect signal: a direction
              that merely damages the model's judgement moves hostile and control
              together, so it can correlate on the raw effect while explaining
              nothing about the trap. Only the paired difference separates the two,
              which is why the work order lists it as a signal of its own.

              The fourth signal is a correlation, so it carries a direction only
              once its LEVELS are checked: ``specificity_level_verdict`` gates a
              candidate out unless its own hostile arm and its own gap are both
              positive, and gates the whole signal out unless the source's are too.
              Correlation says "same contrast"; the levels say "same direction",
              and the sibling claim needs both. When the fourth signal cannot be
              used the ranking degrades to three signals and says so in the
              artifact, because a noisy signal must weaken a claim, not delete an
              experiment.

    co-ablate on held-out items, the seven conditions the work order asks for:
              clean, A alone, B alone, A+B together, and the last three repeated
              with norm-matched random directions at the same two layers. The
              statistic is a difference-in-differences -- the real pair's
              interaction minus the random pair's -- because the joint condition
              removes strictly more norm and the network is non-linear, so a
              positive interaction shows up even for unrelated directions. ``clean``
              is a row of its own carrying the un-differenced margin, since a delta
              says how far the lure lead moved but not what it moved from.

    repair    B's own activation with and without A ablated. If removing A makes B
              fire harder, that is the compensation the Hydra-effect literature
              predicts, measured directly rather than inferred from a margin.

# -------------------------------------------------------- four-signal ranking

# What the fourth signal is, and what it is not.
#
# ``specificity_corr`` is a Pearson r between two per-item vectors of hostile-minus-
# control ``margin_delta`` gaps -- the same per-item quantity that
# ``research.control_specificity_rows`` calls ``specificity_gap``. The per-item
# quantity matches that function's; the SIGNAL does not. A correlation says the two
# features move the gap *together*. It says nothing whatever about which way either of
# them moves it, so on its own it is an AGREEMENT statistic and not a specificity test:
# a pair that is anti-specific in both members correlates exactly as strongly as a pair
# that is cue-specific in both.
#
# docs/metrics_guide.md's rule for every differenced cue quantity is that it may only
# be read together with its hostile arm -- a positive gap under a non-positive hostile
# arm is a control effect, not a trap effect -- and ``control_specificity_rows`` returns
# ``hostile_margin_delta`` and ``control_margin_delta`` next to ``specificity_gap`` for
# exactly that reason. So the level enters here as a GATE and not as another term to be
# averaged. Two features are the same feature at two layers when they point the same
# way, fire on the same items, act the same way when removed, and discriminate the same
# contrast *in the same direction*. The correlation is the "same contrast" half; these
# verdicts are the "same direction" half, and neither half alone is the claim.

    with two ranking rules that drift apart, so this uses the algebra of the weighted
    geometric mean it already computes. With equal weights it returns
    ``G3 = (c*a*e)**(1/3)``, and for any ``w >= 0``::

        G3 ** (3 / (3 + w))  *  s ** (w / (3 + w))  ==  (c * a * e * s**w) ** (1 / (3 + w))

    would rank an anti-correlated pair above an unrelated one. The trade-off is that the
